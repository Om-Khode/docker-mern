# Docker MERN Commands Readme

This readme provides an explanation of each command used in the Docker commands to build and run an MERN application using Docker containers. The provided commands assume you have Docker installed on your system.

### 1. Docker Compose Up: `docker-compose up -d`

- `docker-compose up`: This command is used to start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- `-d`: This flag is optional but recommended when you want to run your services in the background. It stands for "detached" mode, and it allows you to continue using your terminal after starting the services.

### 2. Docker Compose Down: `docker-compose down`

- `docker-compose down`: This command is used to stop and remove the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- `--volumes`: This flag is used to remove the volumes created by Docker Compose along with the containers.
- `--rmi`: This flag is used to remove the images used by the containers. By default, Docker Compose keeps the images to speed up the next docker-compose up command.

With this information, you should have a better understanding of the Docker commands and how to run an MERN application inside a Docker container. Happy coding!
